# Python Flask Mastery Course

Welcome to the **Python Flask Mastery Course**! This comprehensive course is designed to take you from zero to mastery in developing web applications using Flask, a popular Python web framework. Throughout this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Flask, functional programming principles, type safety with Pydantic and MyPy, and how to integrate a React front end with TypeScript.

## Course Overview

In this course, you will gain a deep understanding of:

- **Flask Framework**: Build robust web applications using Flask.
- **Functional Programming**: Emphasize functional programming concepts in Python.
- **Type Safety**: Utilize Pydantic and MyPy to ensure type safety and avoid runtime errors.
- **Front-End Development**: Create a React front end using TypeScript.
- **Database Integration**: Work with either a SQL database or Firebase service.
